# Week 7: Building Apps Using APIs

This week focuses on building practical web applications that consume real-world data from various APIs. The projects demonstrate modern web development practices including asynchronous JavaScript, API integration, responsive design, and user experience considerations.

## Quote Generator

A minimalist web application that fetches and displays inspirational quotes from the Quotable API (https://api.quotable.io). This project demonstrates foundational API integration concepts using vanilla JavaScript.

### Key Features
- Real-time quote generation from a live REST API
- One-click copy to clipboard with visual feedback
- Clean, minimalist interface with smooth interactions
- Offline fallback with local quotes when API is unavailable

### Technical Implementation
- Uses Fetch API with async/await for asynchronous operations
- Implements comprehensive error handling with user feedback
- Features loading states and smooth transitions
- Built with semantic HTML and accessible design principles
- CSS custom properties for consistent theming

### Learning Objectives
- Understand REST API consumption with JavaScript
- Implement asynchronous operations with async/await
- Handle API errors and loading states
- Design responsive user interfaces
- Work with JSON data structures

### Technologies Used
- HTML5 for semantic structure
- CSS3 with Flexbox/Grid and CSS Custom Properties
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- Quotable REST API

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the quote-generator directory
3. Open index.html in a web browser
4. The application works immediately with no configuration required

The Quote Generator serves as a foundation for understanding API integration, preparing for more complex applications that involve a client server architecture.
